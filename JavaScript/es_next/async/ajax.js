 * 
 * AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. 
 * It is a group of inter-related technologies like 
 * JavaScript, DOM, XML, HTML/XHTML, CSS, XMLHttpRequest etc.
 * 
 * AJAX allows you to send and receive data asynchronously without reloading the web page.
 * 
 * AJAX allows you to send only important information to the server not the entire page. 
 * So only valuable data from the client side is routed to the server side.  
 * 
 * AJAX just uses a combination of:
 * A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
 * JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
 * Modern Browsers can use Fetch API instead of the XMLHttpRequest Object.
 * 
 * Note: the purpose of XML is just one, to carry data (in HTTP communication), same as JSON.
 * Difference between them is just in syntax.
 * If you use one of them you need to know only syntax and nothing else.
